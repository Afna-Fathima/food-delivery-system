## 💬 Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to run seed.js every time?
```
A: No! Only once to fill the database initially.
   Data stays in MongoDB permanently.
```

### Q: Will it overwrite existing restaurants?
```
A: No, seed.js checks if data exists first.
   It only creates what's missing.
```

### Q: What if I see "Already exists" messages?
```
A: Perfect! It means the data is already there.
   Just move to step 6 (reload frontend).
```

### Q: How long does seeding take?
```
A: Usually 30-60 seconds total.
   Watch the terminal for completion message.
```

### Q: Can I seed from my local computer?
```
A: Yes! Instead of using Render Shell:
   cd backend
   node seed.js
   (Make sure backend/.env has correct MONGODB_URI)
```
