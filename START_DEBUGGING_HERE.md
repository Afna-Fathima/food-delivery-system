npm start
# Watch for: "MongoDB connected successfully"
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\agust\Downloads\food-delivery-system\backend
node seed.js
# Watch for: "Database seeding completed successfully!"
```

**Terminal 3:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/restaurants
# Watch for: JSON with restaurants
```

**Terminal 4:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\agust\Downloads\food-delivery-system\frontend
npm start
# Browser opens: http://localhost:3000
# Should see: 6 restaurants
```

## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

```
Problem: Backend won't start

Problem: "MongoDB connection error"
  → Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
  → Check MONGODB_URI in backend/.env
  → Verify IP whitelist in MongoDB

Problem: "Port already in use"
  → Kill process: taskkill /PID <PID> /F
  → Or use different port: $env:PORT=5001

Problem: Seeding fails
  → Check backend is running (Terminal 1)
  → Check MongoDB connection
  → Run seeding again

Problem: Frontend shows "Failed to load"
  → Check backend is running (Terminal 1)
  → Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
  → Check F12 Console for errors
