# 🔧 Final Steps to Remove Augustin9489 from GitHub

## ✅ What's Been Done Locally:
- ✅ Both commits now authored by `Afna-Fathima`
- ✅ `main` branch updated with correct author
- ✅ Changes force-pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Remote HEAD set to `main`

## ⚠️ What Still Needs to Be Done (Manual on GitHub):

### Step 1: Change Default Branch to `main`
1. Go to: **https://github.com/Afna-Fathima/food-delivery-system/settings**
2. Click **"Branches"** in the left sidebar
3. Under "Default branch", click the **Change** button
4. Select **`main`** from the dropdown
5. Click **"Update"** to confirm

### Step 2: Delete the `sree` Branch
1. Go to: **https://github.com/Afna-Fathima/food-delivery-system/branches**
2. Find the **`sree`** branch
3. Click the **trash/delete icon** (🗑️)
4. Confirm the deletion

## 📊 Current GitHub Status:

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| `main` branch author | ✅ Afna-Fathima |
| `main` branch code | ✅ Updated |
| `sree` branch author | ❌ Still shows Augustin9489 |
| Default branch | ❌ Still set to `sree` |
| `sree` branch deletion | ⏳ Pending (requires default branch change first) |

---

## 🎯 Why These Steps Are Needed:

GitHub won't allow deletion of the default branch. Once you change `main` to be the default, you'll be able to delete `sree` and all of Augustin9489's commits will disappear from the repo.

---

## ✨ Result After These Steps:

- ✅ Only `main` branch will be visible
- ✅ Only Afna-Fathima will show as contributor
- ✅ No Augustin9489 anywhere
- ✅ Clean, professional repository

**Do these 2 manual steps on GitHub and you're done!** 🎉
